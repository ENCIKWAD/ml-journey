Being expert in Machine Learning 


# ML Journey 🚀

## Goals
- Learn programming (Python, Git, tools).
- Build strong math foundation for ML.
- Understand classical ML algorithms.
- Master deep learning & modern AI models.
- Learn deployment (MLOps) & production practices.
- Build portfolio projects for job market.

## Timeline (flexible)
- Months 0–3: Python, tools, math.
- Months 3–6: Classical ML + projects.
- Months 6–12: Deep Learning (CNNs, NLP, Transformers).
- Months 12–24: MLOps, specialization, large projects.

## Tracking
- ✅ Step 1: Repo created.
- ⏳ Next: Install environment + first coding tasks.

## Notes
This repo will contain all assignments, projects, and notes as I progress.
